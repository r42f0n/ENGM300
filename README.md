Learning Outcomes The   learning   outcomes   for   this   coursework   and   for   the   module   can   be   found   at   the   following   link:
hIps://catalogue.surrey.ac.uk/2024-5/module/ENGM300/SEMR1/1. 
The   par,cular   learning outcomes   being assessed   in the coursework are:
1.          Understand   fundamental   concepts   in   robotics   and   robotic   control.
2.          Implement the   principles of   robotics and   robotic control   in   solving   prac,cal   problems.
Task 
The coursework submission should take the form. of   a   three-part   report   with   a   brief   introduction   and   conclusion.
The   report   should   be 2,000 ± 500 words long   and   include   a   word   count   with   your   submission.   The word count does   not   include equations, ﬁgure captions   and/or table   captions.   Reports should   be submiIed as   .pdfs and will   be subject to the   usual Turnitin   checks.
Part 1: 
In   the   practical   sessions   you   have   been   familiarised   with   the   Trossen   robot.   Using   the
engineering   drawings   at   the   end   of   this   brieﬁng   document   (Appendix   A),   identify   the   link
parameters   and   joint   variables.   Present   these   parameters   using   the   Denavit-Hartenberg   [D-H]
notation.   Finally, show the   individual   link transformation   matrices for the   robot. You should
provide   an   explanation   of   your   process   but   do   not   need   to   calculate   W(B)!   or   T(B)!. (25%) 
Part 2: 
In   terms   of   the   subspace,   reachable   workspace   and   dextrous   workspace,   discuss   the   Trossen
robot's   potential   kinematic   limita,ons. What are those   limitations and   how   may they   impact a   robot sharing those   limitations   in surgical applications?
Taking   a   healthcare   robot   [either   a   research   or   commercial   device],   explain   its   kinematic
diﬀerences   from   the   Trossen   robot. With   illustrations, you   should   also   show   how   the   robot's
design   exploits   diﬀerent   features   to   improve   its   kinematics. You   should   not   use   the   PUMA   robots    as   these   have   already   been   covered   in   depth   during   classes. (25%) 
Part 3: 
With   the   robot   you   have   identiﬁed   in   Part   2, ﬁrstly,  代 写ENGM300 – Medical Robotics Medical Robotics - CourseworkJava
代做程序编程语言 present   its   medical   application. You   should
outline what that application   is and why the application   is   par,cularly suited   to   robotic   delivery
or   assistance. You   should   then   discuss   any   tooling   that   the   robot   requires   to   do   its   job   and   why
its   kinematics   help   to   perform   the   task   so   eﬀectively. (30%) 
Introduc4on and Conclusions: In   the   introduction,   brieﬂy   outline   the   context   for   using
healthcare   robots   and   the   aim   of   the   report   that   follows.   Finish   the   body   of   the   report   by
drawing   the   main   conclusions   from   your   work. (5% each) 
Presenta4on: As   with   any   technical   report,   make   sure   that   your   work   is   presented   correctly.
Please   make   use   of ﬁgures, tables, equations   and   references   to   aid   the   reader.   All   elements
should   be formaIed   using the conventions and   standards expected from   a   scientiﬁc   paper. Take   care   to   use   concise,   precise   and   correct   language   and   grammar   for   the   best   possible communication. (10%) 
Some notes on the requirements: 
The   word   count   begins   with   the ﬁrst   word   of   the   introduction   and   ends   with   the   last   word   of   the conclusions.   It does   not   include   references, citations, equa,ons, and ﬁgure/table   cap,ons   and content. You   are   encouraged   to   use ﬁgures   to   illustrate   concepts   and,   as   there   is   no   limit   on
pages, any ﬁgures   and   tables   should   be   presented   at   a   sensible   size.   It   is   not   anticipated   that   you would   need   an   appendix   for   this   report.   However,   if   you   feel   that   there   is   content   suited   to
appendices,   i.e., supplementary   information   not   for   assessment, you   may   include   this.
Healthcare   robot   is speciﬁed   in the   brief as opposed to   surgical   robot. You   may   use   any   robot
with   a   medical   application, which   includes   those   robots   used   for   surgery.   You   may   also   use   a
robot   that   has   been   covered   in   the   course   to-date – though   not   the   PUMA   series.   However,   it   is anticipated that the   robot   has   kinematic   interest; deliberately choosing a   robot with very   few
degrees   of   freedom   or   highly   simpliﬁed   mechanics   should   be   avoided.   Such   a   simple   robot   would limit   the   depth   and   substance   that   you   can   provide   in   many   areas   of   this   coursework!
